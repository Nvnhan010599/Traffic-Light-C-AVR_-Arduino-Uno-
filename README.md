# Traffic-Light-C-AVR_-Arduino-Uno-
This project represent a small application of C# (winform using Serial port and Timer) and AVR to program for ATMEGA (ARDUINO UNO R3) simulink on Proteus


You can see 3 folder: 
> **traff** : contain avr code ( GPIO, UART) 

  Have Frame UART : "@,%d,%d,%d\r\n",light,dA,dB 
 
> ** Traffic_Light** : contain C# code 
> **simulation** : contain Proteus file (i couldn't remember version used)

__ The last thing I want to say is: This project is demo and reference, I have done and it's worked but the last time i used was 1 year ago. Yah... If you want to study or reference, may be i spend 1 or more week to understand__ 

Thanks
